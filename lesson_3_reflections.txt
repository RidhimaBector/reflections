When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-> Other people are also working on the project.
-> I access the code through different devices, and hence want the project to be stored on the web.
-> I want to make my work public

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?
-> I might be contributing to a huge project where I am only concerned with certain aspects of it. Cloning the entire 
repository locally will be of no use to me.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
-> Branch is creating a commit such that there exists another commit with the same parent as the new commit. If a label 
is not put on this new commit, it is likely to get lost if its commit id is not stored separately. Putting a label on 
this commit is what making a branch essentially is. Branches are made in the same repository and are helpful when we 
want to try a new feature or test a different implementation while keeping the master active.
-> Cloning is the process of making a copy of an existing repository. The repositoy to be clones can be present on GitHub
(remote repository) or maybe present on the users computer (local repository), while the copy (cloned repository) is 
present locally. Cloning is usually done to have a local copy of the project. You can create, test and debug new features
on your system, and then push the finished commits onto GitHub.
-> Forking is the process of cloning a remote repository such that the clones repository is also present on GitHub. It is 
used when the creaters of the original repository dont give you permission to make changes.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
-> Local copy allows us to run the code and test/debug/modify the code even if we dont have internet connection.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
-> Though Git allows me to have local copies, which i can view/update/run(if it is a code) , collaborating with other 
people will be tough if there is no online platform where the code of the entire project resides, and people can freely 
view, discuss and suggest changes, which is exactly what GitHub is.
