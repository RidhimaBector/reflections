When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-> Other people are also working on the project.
-> I access the code through different devices, and hence want the project to be stored on the web.
-> I want to make my work public

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?
-> I might be contributing to a huge project where I am only concerned with certain aspects of it. Cloning the entire 
repository locally will be of no use to me.
