What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When we initialize a repository a .git document containing metadata about the newly creater repository is created.
If we dont initialize a repository, we cant save and use different versions of our project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Repository contains various files along with metadata about them.A repository contains a working directory, 
index and head. The working directory contains all the source files. Staging area contains those files which we are 
tracking, i.e. those files for which we are interested to store multiple versions. Staging area gives us the flexibility 
of deciding which files need to be tracked.
